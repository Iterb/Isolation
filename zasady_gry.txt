The following rules is from the website of cs670:

Each of the two players has one piece.
The board has 7Â´7 positions which initially contain squares, except for the initial positions of the pieces.
A move consists of two subsequent actions:
	moving one's piece to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) field that contains a square but not the opponent's piece,
	removing any square with no piece on it
If a player cannot move any more, he/she loses the game.
